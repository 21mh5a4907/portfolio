            <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Yadavilli Vinay, a passionate and dedicated frontend developer currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at Aditya College of Engineering. I have a strong foundation in programming and web development, with a diverse skill set that includes C++, Java, Python, PHP, .NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, React, and more.

With a diploma in Mechanical Engineering from KITS College, I've combined my technical expertise with hands-on experience in quality control roles at GreenTech Industries and Hyundai Mobis. These roles honed my attention to detail and problem-solving abilities, ensuring that I bring a meticulous and efficient approach to my work in software development.

In addition to my academic and professional background, I have actively engaged in various projects ranging from machine learning applications to IoT and web development. Noteworthy projects include a Crop Recommendation system using Flask, Home Automation and Fire Fighting Robots with Arduino, and a Career Guidance web application.

I am also an avid problem solver, having solved over 200 problems on both LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, and earned 5-star badges in C++, SQL, and Java on HackerRank. My commitment to continuous learning and improvement is reflected in my EPAM certification in frontend technologies.

I am seeking a challenging role in frontend development where I can leverage my skills, continue to learn, and contribute to impactful projects within a forward-thinking organization.

            <p>Biography:

I am Vinay Yadavilli, a final year BTech student pursuing a degree in Internet of Things (IoT) at JNTUK University. With a passion for technology and innovation, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and technologies, including Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, C++, and frontend technologies. Throughout my academic journey, I have been deeply involved in exploring the potential of IoT and embedded systems to solve real-world challenges.

Personal Story:

Growing up with a curiosity for technology, I found my calling in the dynamic field of IoT during my undergraduate studies at JNTUK University. It was here that I embarked on a journey of discovery, delving into the intricacies of programming and the limitless possibilities of connected devices.

One of the highlights of my academic career was the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, each aimed at leveraging IoT to address pressing societal needs. Projects such as the Omni Directional Robot, Firefighting Robot, and Anti-Sleep Alarm stand as testaments to my dedication and ingenuity in merging theoretical knowledge with practical application.

In the pursuit of excellence, I have continually sought to expand my skill set and deepen my understanding of emerging technologies. Whether it's delving into the complexities of backend development with Python and SQL or crafting seamless user experiences with HTML and CSS, I am committed to staying at the forefront of innovation.

Beyond the confines of academia, I find fulfillment in applying my technical expertise to create tangible solutions that make a difference in people's lives. As I approach the culmination of my undergraduate journey, I am excited about the prospect of channeling my passion for IoT into meaningful projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.
